      <a id = "About"><h2>About Me</h2></a>
      <p>After graduating college, I started teaching middle school science.  I have always had a passion for computer science, so I started an after school club teaching students to code using <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/" target="\_blank">Codecademy</a> and <a href = "https://code.org/" target="\_blank">Code.org</a>. I am excited for the opportunity to actually apply some of the principles and concepts I have introduced to my students to a career as a developer. I love solving problems and I love working in a team environment!  I've collaborated on curriculum in the past with my fellow educators and loved the opportunity to brainstorm ideas, learn from one another, and create new things. Outside of coding and teaching, I have many hobbies: </p>
